**KHUSHITOKEN README**

Hello there! Welcome to the KHUSHITOKEN project. This README will guide you through what KHUSHITOKEN is all about and how you can use it.

### What is KHUSHITOKEN?

KHUSHITOKEN is a Solidity smart contract project designed to create and manage a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It follows the ERC-20 token standard, making it compatible with various Ethereum-based applications and services.

### Key Features

Token Details: KHUSHITOKEN stores essential information such as its name, symbol, and total supply, making it easily recognizable within the Ethereum ecosystem.

Token Minting: With the `mint` function, you can create new tokens and add them to the total supply, facilitating token issuance and distribution.

Token Burning: The `burn` function allows you to destroy tokens, helping manage token supply and implement burn mechanisms.

Balance Management: KHUSHITOKEN keeps track of token balances for each Ethereum address, enabling secure and efficient token transfers.

### How to Use KHUSHITOKEN

1. Deploy the Contract: Deploy the KHUSHITOKEN contract to the Ethereum blockchain using your preferred development environment or tool.

2. Interact with the Contract: Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using Ethereum wallets, dApps, or custom scripts. Mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, or query token balances as needed.
